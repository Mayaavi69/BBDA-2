Notes:
Customer and Portfolio have a one-to-many relationship, meaning one customer can have multiple portfolios.
Portfolio and Investment have a one-to-many relationship, as one portfolio can include multiple investments.
Investment and Transaction also have a one-to-many relationship, indicating multiple transactions can occur for a single investment.
Investment and FinancialProduct have a many-to-many relationship. This relationship is realized through the InvestmentType field, which matches the ProductType in FinancialProduct.
This diagram provides a foundational structure for an Investment Management System. You can expand it by adding additional entities or attributes to capture more specific requirements, such as adding risk assessments, performance metrics, or user authentication details.
